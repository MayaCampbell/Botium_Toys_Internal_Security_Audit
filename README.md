# Scenerio
Botium Toys, a small U.S. business with a single location serving as its main office, storefront, and warehouse, has seen significant growth in its online presence, attracting customers domestically and internationally. This expansion has increased the pressure on their IT department to support global operations.

Concerned about maintaining compliance and business operations amid this growth, the IT manager has decided to conduct an internal IT audit. She aims to secure the company's infrastructure, identify and mitigate potential risks, and ensure compliance with online payment processing and E.U. regulations.

To initiate this process, the IT manager has implemented the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), defined the audit scope and goals, cataloged IT-managed assets, and completed a risk assessment. The audit's objective is to evaluate the risks and potential fines the company may face due to its current security posture.

My task is to review the IT manager’s scope, goals, and risk assessment report, and then perform an internal audit by completing a controls and compliance checklist.
